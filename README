== Rovers ==

This is my Mars Rovers implementation.

It currently has two possible entry points: by CommandLine, running rovers-execution, or via web, running rovers-web-interface.

Both of them receive a string of characters as input, being whitespace-insensitive, and return a string representing each of the rover's final location.
